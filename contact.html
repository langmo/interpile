<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Before you contact us with a question, please read the <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/documentation.html">Documentation</a> to check if your question might already be answered there.</p>
<h2>Bugs and Feature Requests</h2>
<p>
	InterPile is hosted on GitHub. As such, the easiest way to report bugs, feature requests, and similar is to create a so called &quot;issue&quot;, which you can do here:
	<a href="https://github.com/langmo/interpile/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/langmo/interpile/issues</a>
</p>
<p>
	The GitHub &quot;issue&quot; system has the advantage that it is easier to track issues, as well as that other users can comment on these issues. Thus, we prefer issues over e-mails, even though you can still write us an e-mail if you prefer to do so.
</p>
<h2>Contact by E-Mail</h2>
<p>We are interested in your opinion on our research, and on your user experience using InterPile. If you have any idea how to extend our analysis, if you think that videos of certain sandpile identity dynamics are missing, or if you would like a feature to be implemented into InterPile &ndash; then tell us!
