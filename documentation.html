The best way to learn more about the Abelian sandpile identity dynamics induced by harmonic fields is to read our paper on this topic, which will be made available as a preprint soon.
</p>
<p> A tutorial on how to generate videos showing the harmonic sandpile dynamics using InterPile is in preparation. It should however be quite intuitive, and you can simply try it out yourself. If you have problems, please contact us!
