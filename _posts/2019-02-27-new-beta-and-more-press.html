title: New beta and more press
---
<p>We released beta 3 of Interpile 1.1, which now includes the first glimpse on some new functionality: unique coordinates identifying recurrent configurations, as well as group homomorphisms between sandpile groups on certain NxN domains.
All that is however yet pretty preliminary, extremely slow and potentially even buggy...well, it's only a first glimpse.
<p>Furthermore, there was some more press coverage of our <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/2821" target="_blank">PNAS paper</a> in <a href="https://derstandard.at/2000098066680/Beruehmtes-Sandhaufen-Modell-offenbart-bisher-unbekannte-Eigenschaften" target="_blank">derstandart.at</a>, <a href="https://science.orf.at/stories/2964573/" target="_blank">science.orf.at</a>, and <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-02-famous-sandpile-shown-sand-dune.html" target="_blank">phys.org</a>.
