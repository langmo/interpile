title: Video of fifth order harmonics
---
<p>We uploaded a bunch of additional <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/videos.html">videos</a>, including the first video showing fifth-order harmonic sandpile identity dynamics. The other videos mainly show the sandpile dynamics for lower order harmonics when starting with some interesting fractal patterns found in the videos of certain harmonics.
