title: New beta and upcoming paper
---
<p>We released beta 4 of Interpile 1.1, just in time for our upcoming paper. The main new functionality is that the families of sandpile monomorphisms from every NxM domain to all s(N+1)-1xs(M+1)-1 domains are now completely implemented and bug free (hopefully, at least, that's why it's still only a beta). What are these sandpile monomorphisms we are talking about? Check the theoretical background in our upcoming paper "Sandpile monomorphisms and harmonic functions" from Moritz Lang and Mikhail Shkolnikov, which should be available at arXive at Tuesday, 04/30/2019. We keep you updated as soon as the paper is online, and we have the full reference!
