<p>In preparation for the publication of the preprint of our research on the harmonic dynamics of the Abelian sandpile identity, we created this homepage. The current version of the open-source software InterPile used to generate these dynamics is already available for download. Videos showing the sandpile identity dynamics induced by different harmonics will be made available soon.
