title: First Domain Scaling Movies and new Release of InterPile
---
<p>
The first <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/videos.html">videos</a> are online showing configurations corresponding to the sandpile identity dynamics induced by a given harmonic fields at the same or scaled times for increasing domain sizes. This visualizes both the capability of our approach for renormalization, as well as the super-position of different time scales.
<p>We also released a new beta of InterPile (beta 3), with which these videos can be easily generated. Feel free to send us your best videos!
