title : Abelian sandpiles and their harmonic dynamics
pagetitle : Home
---

<p>
The identity of the Abelian sandpile group shows smooth 1-periodic dynamics induced by harmonic fields. This website summarizes results on the properties of these dynamics, and also provides an open-source software solution called <i>InterPile</i> to interactively explore and manipulate sandpiles on various lattices, as well as to generate movies showing the dynamics of the sandpile identity or any other recurrent configuration induced by arbitrary harmonic functions and for arbitrarily defined lattices.

<h2>Videos and Software</h2>
<p>To access the videos showing the sandpile identity dynamics, visit our <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/videos.html">Videos</a> section. To create own videos showing the sandpile identity dynamics, download <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/download.html">InterPile</a>.</p>
<h2>Learn more</h2>
<p>To learn more about the Abelian sandpile identity dynamics, read our manuscript on this topic. This manuscript will presumably be available as a pre-print at Friday, 28th of June, 2018.</p>
