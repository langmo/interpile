<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The abelian sandpile model is a cellular automaton defined on a domain of the standard square lattice. It serves as the archetypical model for self-organized criticality, and important process in physics, biology, geology and other fields. The recurrent configurations of the sandpile model form an abelian group, the sandpile group. This website summarizes our results on this group.
</p>
<h2>Harmonic sandpile dynamics</h2>
<p>
The identity of the sandpile group shows smooth 1-periodic dynamics induced by harmonic fields. To analyze these harmonic dynamics, we provide an open-source software solution called <i>InterPile</i> to interactively explore and manipulate sandpiles on various domains, as well as to generate movies showing the dynamics of the sandpile identity or any other recurrent configuration induced by arbitrary harmonic functions and for arbitrarily defined domains.
</p>
<h2>Sandpile monomorphisms</h2>
<p>
The concept of criticality is strongly related to scale-invariance, i.e. certain properties of a critical system, like the distribution of avalanche sizes for the sandpile model, remain qualitatively the same under spatial-temporal scaling. We recently showed that also the sandpile group itself is susceptible to such scaling relationships in the form of families of monomorphisms from each sandpile group on an NxM rectangular domain to all sandpile groups on s(N+1)-1xs(M+1)-1 domains.
